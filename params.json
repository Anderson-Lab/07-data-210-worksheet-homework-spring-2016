  "body": "In this homework you will create a database from scratch, insert, update, delete, and select entries from it.\r\n\r\n1. Define the following tables in postgres. The first one can be called Persons and the second can be called Courses.\r\n\r\n| ID            | Name          | GPA   |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\r\n| 1             | Paul          | 3.8   |\r\n| 2             | Aspen         |   3.2 |\r\n| 3             | Sebastian     |  3.85 |\r\n| 4             | Sarah         |   3.9 |\r\n| 5             | Jill          |   2.5 |\r\n\r\nID should be the primary key. Name should be a varchar with a maximum size of 10, and GPA should be a decimal.\r\n\r\n| ID            | PID           | Name   |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\r\n| 1             | 2             | DATA 210   |\r\n| 2             | 2             | CSCI 334 |\r\n| 3             | 3             | CSCI 334 |\r\n| 4             | 4             | DATA 210 |\r\n| 5             | 5             | CSCI 470 |\r\n\r\nThere is one foreign key and that is PID which references Courses. The primary key is ID, and the Name is varchar of size 10.\r\n\r\nFor this question, you will need to master both the create table function and the insert function.\r\n\r\n2. Now write a simple select statement that returns the GPA and only the GPA for everyone.\r\n\r\n3. Now write a select statement that returns all the columns from the Courses table.\r\n\r\n4. Now write a select statement that returns the names of the people registered for DATA 210 (i.e., an inner join).\r\n\r\n5. Now write a select statement that returns the courses that everyone is registered for. If they aren't registered for any courses, you should till return the person as they are still a student.\r\n\r\n6. Now write a select statement that counts the number of people registered for DATA 210.\r\n\r\n7. Now write a select statement that returns the average GPA of the people registered for DATA 210.\r\n\r\n8. Now write a select statement that returns the average GPA of people registered for each class (i.e., group by).\r\n\r\n9. Now update the GPA of Aspen to be 3.5.\r\n\r\n10. Now delete Paul from the persons table.\r\n\r\n11. Now try to delete Aspen from the persons table.\r\n\r\n12. A few questions to think about: What is the purpose of an index? Do we have any indexes in our database? What is the command to create an index?",
